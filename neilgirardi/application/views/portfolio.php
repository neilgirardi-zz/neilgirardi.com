             <p class="grid_6">I did the front-end development for <a class="portfolio_link parents_highlight" href="http://deals.parents.com/national">Deals.Parents.com</a> in 2010 while working with Group Commerce.  <a class="portfolio_link parents_highlight" href="http://groupcommerce.com">Group Commerce</a> is an e-commerce company which provides white-label group deal-buying solutions to publishers. This particular e-commerce site was commissioned by <a class="portfolio_link parents_highlight" href="http://parentsmagazine.com">Parents Magazine</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="am_highlight grid_6 nudge_top">Allmenus.com</h2>
            <p class="grid_6">I took ownership of front-end development for <a class="portfolio_link am_highlight" href="http://allmenus.com">Allmenus.com</a> and <a class="portfolio_link am_highlight" href="http://campusfood.com">Campusfood.com</a> after joining the Dotmenu development team in April of 2011. At the time, the site's page load time was prohibitively long. This in term had a negative impact on our search engine rankings. I was able to reduce the page load time by a factor of four.</p> 
        <p class="grid_6">In October, 2011 Dotmenu merged with <a class="am_highlight portfolio_link" href="http://grubhub.com">GrubHub</a>. I have since been a proud and happy member of the GrubHub NY development team. Over the past six months we've created two android apps for the grubhub product line. These apps eill soon be publically available on the Android market.</p>

            <p class="grid_6">I created this web site for Fat Boy Records recording artist Celsius in 2010. This site features JavaScript animation, a custom MP3 player, and uses the YouTube API to make the artist's video chanel directly available.  I developed a custom back-end for the site which enables the artist to easily manage content and email campaigns.</p>

            <h2 class="easyexpand_highlight grid_6  nudge_top">EasyExpand()</h2>
            <p class="grid_6">This is a jQuery plugin I made in 2011. I was working for <a class="portfolio_link easyexpand_highlight href="http://groupcommerce.com">Group Commerce</a> at the time, enhancing the UI of their deal publishing CMS. I was asked to add an "accordion" menu. We were already using jQuery UI but the built-in accordion did not suit our needs. At issue was the fact that the jQuery accordion permits the user to open only one item at a time. This plugin is light-weight, easily customizable, and does not limit the user's interaction.</p>
